🔥 Hashing: A Complete Breakdown
📌 What is Hashing?

Hashing is a technique used to map data (keys) to a fixed-size value (hash code) using a hash function. It is commonly used for:
✅ Fast data retrieval (O(1) in best case)
✅ Efficient indexing (Databases, Caches, Hash Tables)
✅ Cryptographic security (Passwords, Digital Signatures)

🏗 How Hashing Works

    A key (input data) is passed to a hash function.
    The function generates a hash code (integer value).
    This hash code is mapped to an index in a data structure (e.g., an array).
    If multiple keys map to the same index, we handle collisions (explained later).
